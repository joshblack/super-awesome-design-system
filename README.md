> Sandbox for building out super awesome design systems

This project is a personal development environment for trying out different
techniques for building a design system. This includes multiple ways of building
components, different styling strategies, building websites, CLI commands, and
more.

This work is not intended to be stable or used as a reference. It's just meant
to be fun. If you're checking out this project, hope it's helpful!
